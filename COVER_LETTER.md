# Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in positions that align with my passion for bridging technology excellence and human impact. With 15+ years of enterprise infrastructure leadership combined with a recent commitment to STEM education equity, I bring both technical depth and mission-driven vision to every role.

## Why I'm Writing

Over my career, I've built enterprise-scale systems for Fortune 500 companies—implementing Zero Trust architectures at JP Morgan Chase, designing disaster recovery protocols at Bank of America, and leading global engineering teams at FICO. But in 2026, I realized my greatest impact opportunity wasn't optimizing enterprise infrastructure—it was opening doors for the next generation.

In January 2026, I founded **Detroit Automation Academy** to bring hands-on robotics, 3D printing, and coding education to Detroit-area youth who lack access to quality STEM programs. One month later, I coordinated an inaugural program at the Boys and Girls Club Grand Opening reaching 40-50+ students across five simultaneous sessions. This work has fundamentally shifted how I view technology leadership: not as an end in itself, but as a vehicle for educational and economic opportunity.

## What I Bring

**For Organizations Seeking Educational Innovation:**
- Deep expertise designing hands-on, project-based learning in robotics, 3D printing, and automation
- Ability to build and lead educator teams that inspire and challenge students
- Track record coordinating complex multi-station programs with professional execution
- Strategic partnership development (e.g., Boys and Girls Club of Greater Detroit)

**For Organizations Seeking Technical Leadership:**
- 15+ years architecting enterprise infrastructure (Apple security, MDM, Zero Trust, cloud platforms)
- Expert Python developer and automation engineer—designing systems that scale
- Proven ability managing global teams, advising C-suite executives, and translating technical complexity into strategic action
- Experience in highly regulated financial sectors (JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Moody's)

**For Organizations Seeking Mission-Driven Culture Leaders:**
- Authentic commitment to equity and educational access—not performative
- Ability to recruit, mentor, and develop talent across disciplines
- Track record building cross-functional teams (facilitation, logistics, marketing, partnerships)
- Belief that technology is most powerful when it serves human flourishing

## My Ask

I'm selectively exploring opportunities where I can:
1. **Lead technology strategy** in organizations committed to education, equity, or human impact
2. **Build educational programs** that scale STEM access beyond Detroit
3. **Mentor and develop** technical talent alongside educators and community leaders
4. **Combine technical depth** with educational mission—the intersection where I've found my highest contribution

Whether that's a CTO/VP Engineering role at an edtech company, a leadership position at a mission-driven nonprofit, or a strategic technology partnership with an educational institution—I'm interested in conversations about how to accelerate Detroit's transformation into a center for innovation and opportunity.

## The Numbers

- **15+ years** enterprise technology leadership
- **$250M+ infrastructure** managed or architected
- **5 Fortune 500 companies** across financial and technology sectors
- **1 month** from founding Detroit Automation Academy to inaugural program reaching 40-50+ students
- **100% facilitation team** recruited and trained for professional delivery
- **Fluent in:** Python, Bash, Infrastructure-as-Code, Jamf Pro, Apple ecosystems, team leadership, strategic planning

## Let's Talk

I'd welcome a conversation about how my combination of technical excellence and educational mission can contribute to your team's success. Feel free to reach out:
