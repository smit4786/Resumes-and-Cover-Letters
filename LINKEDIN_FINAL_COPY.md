## 📝 ABOUT SECTION

I'm a technology leader on a mission to democratize STEM education and build economic opportunity in Detroit.

For 15+ years, I've designed enterprise-scale infrastructure for Fortune 500 companies—implementing Zero Trust architectures at JP Morgan Chase, leading global engineering teams at FICO, and advising C-suite executives on technology strategy. But in 2026, I realized my highest impact opportunity wasn't optimizing corporate systems—it was opening doors for the next generation.

**Detroit Automation Academy** (founded Jan 2026) is my answer to a critical gap: Detroit-area youth with limitless potential but limited access to quality STEM education. We deliver hands-on learning in robotics, 3D printing, and coding through partnerships with community organizations like Boys and Girls Club of Greater Detroit. Our inaugural program (Feb 2026) reached 40-50+ students in concurrent 5-session workshops.

**What I believe:**
- Technology is most powerful when it serves human flourishing
- Hands-on, project-based learning unlocks potential in ways traditional education can't
- Detroit's youth represent untapped innovation and leadership talent
- STEM education should be accessible regardless of zip code or background

**My background:**
- **Enterprise Infrastructure:** 15+ years designing systems for JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, FICO, Moody's
- **Skills:** Python, automation, Zero Trust architecture, iOS/macOS ecosystems, infrastructure-as-code
- **Leadership:** Built and mentored high-performing teams, advised executives, managed vendor relationships globally
- **Education:** Ongoing studies at University of Michigan (leadership, innovation, Python); certified in project management, Apple platforms, Jamf Pro

**Current roles:**
- Founder & Lead Facilitator — Detroit Automation Academy
- Apple Foundation Program Mentor — College for Creative Studies
- Crowd Security Manager — Ilitch Sports and Entertainment

**Looking to connect with:**
- Educators passionate about STEM equity
- Community organizations interested in youth programming
- Tech professionals open to mentoring the next generation
- Investors/partners supporting educational innovation in Detroit
- Anyone building the future of work and learning

Let's talk about how technology and education can unlock Detroit's potential together.
